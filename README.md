## Political Weather Map

We will assess how much a country's tone towards immigrants in news articles is associated with its immigration rates. For immigration tone, we will use the DocTone column in the GDELT data and filter on "immigra" in the ContextualText column. For immigration rates, we will use immigration data and divide the raw number of immigrants by the population.
